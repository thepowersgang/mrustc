Overview
========

Graph of "Basic Blocks"
- Stored as a vector, integer indexes between each other
- All function calls terminate their block
- Varaibles are single-assigment, but mutable via &mut or field accesses


Operations and value types
=====

LValues (assignable locations)
------------------------------

- `B` - User-declared binding (with a name and slot index)
- `TEMP` - Compiler-inserted temporary (with just an index)
- `ARG` - Function argument (with index only)
- `STATIC` - Reference to a `static` or `static mut`
- `RETURN` - The function's return value
- `LVALUE.f` - Refers to the field `f` of the inner `LVALUE`
- `*LVALUE` - Dereference a pointer (&-ptr or rawptr)
- `LVALUE[LVALUE]` - Index into an array (slice accesses use operator overloads)
- `(LVALUE as VARIANT)` - Downcast `LVALUE` into the specified enum variant (to access it as that variant)

RValues (usable values)
-----------------------

- `use(LVALUE)` - Read out of an LVALUE
- `&'rgn LVALUE` - Immutably borrow an LVALUE
- `&'rgn mut LVALUE` - Mutably borrow an LVALUE
- `LVALUE as TYPE` - Primitive cast operation
- `LVALUE <op> LVALUE` - Binary operation (on numeric primitives only)
- `<op> LVALUE` - Unary operation (numeric primitives and booleans only)
- `[RVALUE; RVALUE]` - Construct a sized array
- `[RVALUE, ...]` - Construct a literal array
- `(RVALUE, ...)` - Construct a tuple
- `PATH { f: RVALUE, ... }` - Construct a named struct
- `meta(LVALUE)` - Extract the fat pointer metadata for an lvalue
- `fatptr(LVALUE, LVALUE)` - Construct a fat pointer from a pair of lvalues
- `CONSTANT` - Subset of RValues that are known at compile-time

Terminators
-----------
- TODO

Generation Notes
================

Drop Scopes
-----------

- Requirements:
 - Standard scoped definitions (e.g. blocks) - Where the runtime scope and the generator's stack frame correspond
 - Deferred scope completion (e.g. within match codegen)
 - Generated drops for panic cleanup.
 - Would want to track moves within sub-blocks (i.e. if/match arms)

- Ideas
 - Scope IDs passed to terminator construction.
 - RAII guards to ensure that a constructed scope is dropped (and all child scopes are terminated before it is)
 - Scopes contain child scopes (started within them)
 - Special named scope for the entire function.
 - For match, scope handles can be passed around


Validation
----------
- [CFA] All code paths from bb0 must end with either a return or a diverge (or loop)
- [ValState] No drops or usage of uninitalised values (Uninit, Moved, or Dropped)
- [ValState] Temporaries are write-once.
 - Requires maintaining state information for all variables/temporaries with support for loops
- [Flat] Types must be valid (correct type for slot etc.)
 - Simple check of all assignments/calls/...

Optimisiation
-------------
- Constant propagation
- Dead code
- Useless assignments
- Basic-block chaining
- De-duplication


TODO
====
- Create a variant of the `CALL` terminator that takes a path instead of a LValue
- Create a `CallPath` RValue for calling functions that never diverge (e.g. some intrinsics)
 - OR: Have a new RValue and Terminator - `CallIntrinsic`?
