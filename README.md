# Mutabah's Rust Compiler

_In-progress_ alternative rust compiler. Capable of building a fully-working copy of rustc, but not suitable for everyday use (due to terrible error messages).

Intro
===
This project is a "simple" rust compiler written in C++ that is able to bootstrap a "recent" rustc, but may eventually become a full separate re-implementation.

As `mrustc`'s primary goal is bootstrapping `rustc`, and as such it tends to assume that the code it's compiling is valid (and any errors in the generated code are mrustc bugs). Code generation is done by emitting a high-level assembly (currently very ugly C, but LLVM/cretone/GIMPLE/... could work) and getting an external tool (i.e. `gcc`) to do the heavy-lifting of optimising and machine code generation.

Progress
--------

- Builds working copies of `rustc` and `cargo` from a release source tarball
  - Supports (and can bootstrap) rustc 1.19.0, 1.29.0, 1.39.0, and 1.54.0
- Supported Targets:
  - x86-64 linux GNU (fully bootstrap tested using Debian 10.9)
  - x86-64 windows MSVC (runnable executables on Windows 10, but bootstrap hasn't been fully tested)
  - x86_64 and arm64 macOS
  - (incomplete) x86 windows MSVC
- `rustc` bootstrap tested and validated (1.19.0 isn't fully repeatable, but later versions are)
  - See the script `TestRustcBootstrap.sh` for how this was done.


Getting Started
===============

You can set the number of jobs (parallel builds) by setting the enviromment variable `PARLEVEL`, e.g. `PARLEVEL=$(nproc)` for CPU core count. This can and will break at times, as such outside of toying around, it's best to do `PARLEVEL=1` or let mrustc figure it out by itself.

Dependencies
------------
- C++14-compatible compiler (tested with gcc 5.4 and gcc 6, and MSVC 2015)
- C11 compatible C compiler (for output, see above)
- `make` (for the mrustc makefiles)
- `patch` (For doing minor edits to the rustc source)
- `libz-dev` (used to reduce size of bytecode files, linux only - windows uses vcpkg to download it)
- `curl` (for downloading the rust source, linux only)
- `cmake` (at least 3.4.3, required for building llvm in rustc)

Linux GNU and macOS
-----
- `make RUSTCSRC` - Downloads the rustc source tarball (1.29.0 by default)
- `make -f minicargo.mk` - Builds `mrustc` and `minicargo`, then builds `libstd`, `libtest`, finally `rustc` and `cargo`
- `make -C run_rustc` - Build `libstd` and a "hello, world" using the above-built rustc

BSD
---
Similar to Linux, but you might need to
- specify the rustc default target explicitly
- specify the compiler
- use `gmake` to run GNU make

e.g. `gmake CC=cc RUSTC_TARGET=x86_64-unknown-freebsd -f minicargo.mk`

Windows
--------
(Tested with VS2015)
- Download and extract `rustc-1.29.0-src.tar.gz` to the repository root (such that the `rustc-1.29.0-src` directory is present)
  - NOTE: I am open to suggestions for how to automate that step
- Open `vsproject/mrustc.sln` and build minicargo
- Run `vsproject/run_hello.cmd` to build libstd and "hello, world", and run it
  - There are other similar scripts for building cargo and rustc. Cargo works,
    but rustc hasn't fully been tested (building LLVM on windows has been a challenge)


Building non-rustc code
=======================

To build your own code with mrustc, first you need to build at least libcore (and probably the full standard library).
This can be done on Linux or macOS by running `make -f minicargo.mk LIBS`, or on windows with `build_std.cmd`.

Next, run
- `minicargo -L <path_to_libstd> <crate_path>` to build a cargo project.
- or, `mrustc -L <path_to_libstd> --out-dir <output_directory> <path_to_main.rs>` to directly invoke mrustc.

For additional options, both programs have a `--help` option.

Diagnosing Issues and Reporting Bugs
====================================

Debugging
---------
Both the makefiles and `minicargo` write the compiler's stdout to a file in the output directory, e.g. when building
`output/libcore.hir` it'll save to `output/libcore.hir_dbg.txt`.
To get full debug output for a compilation run, set the environment variable `MRUSTC_DEBUG` to a : separated list of the passes you want to debug
(pass names are printed in every log line). E.g. `MRUSTC_DEBUG=Expand:Parse make -f minicargo.mk`

Bug Reports
-----------
Please try to include the following when submitting a bug report:
- What you're trying to build
- Your host system version (e.g. Ubuntu 17.10)
- C/C++ compiler version
- Revision of the mrustc repo that you're running

Support and Discussion
----------------------
For problems that don't warrant opening an issue (e.g. help in running the compiler), join the IRC channel - `irc.libera.chat#mrustc`


Current Features
================
- Full compilation chain including HIR and MIR stages (outputting to C)
- MIR optimisations (to take some load off the C compiler)
- Optional exhaustive MIR validation (set the `MRUSTC_FULL_VALIDATE` environment variable)
- Functional cargo clone (minicargo)
  - Includes build script support
- Procedural macros (custom derive)
- Custom target specifications
  - See `docs/target.md`

Plans
=====

Short-term
----------
- Fix currently-failing tests (mostly in type inference)
- Fix all known TODOs in MIR generation (still some possible leaks)

Medium-term
-----------
- Propagate lifetime annotations so that MIR can include a borrow checker
- Emit C code that is (more) human readable (uses names from the original source, reduced/no gotos)
- Add alternate backends (e.g. LLVM IR, cretonne, ...)
- Working parallel builds (fix races)
